The blog seeks to explore ways in which one can own a home/property in Kenya. It will as well give comparisons, PROs and CONs in trying to arrive at a choice to make in terms of the different construction techniques and materials used.

Gives the potential homeowner enough information on whether to purchase a home that has been listed already or construct from ground up.

As a user, I can:
1. See the blog, its image(s) and its metadata on page load from a remote server
2. Use a form to create a new listing for either parcels of land or houses on sale
3. See listings for land and built houses for sale. If a user chooses to build they can filter to get land listings. If they opt for a buy option they can filter them too.
4. Click on the heart icon to favourite an image.
